I started my web development career as a [Python programmer](https://adevait.com/python), and my go-to framework in those days was Django. I came across Laravel only 1.5 years into my career and started building stuff using the framework. Eventually, I got better at Laravel and reached a point where I would choose between the frameworks depending on requirements.

For example, if I saw that a project has pages that require something to happen in real-time, I would immediately choose Laravel over Django. Back in the day, Laravel used to come with Vue pre-installed and pre-configured with every new project.

Laravel has come a long way, and the options for creating modern, reactive web applications using the framework are many. There's Inertia.js, Alpine.js, Livewire, and more. But the framework hasn't said goodbye to the old ways of doing things. It's still possible and very straightforward to set up Vue or React with a Laravel project.

In this article, I'll walk you through the process of bootstrapping a brand new Laravel project and integrating React with it so all [Laravel developers](https://adevait.com/laravel), as well as [React.js developers](https://adevait.com/react-native) out there, can proceed with the project safely.
